DHART (Design, Humanfactors, Analysis, and RoboTics) is a library for the fast creating of navigation graphs, visibility analysis, and pathplanning.  

DHART is installed through `pip`, so it may take a minute for the package to install the first time you run it. After the first time, the extension will be much faster.
